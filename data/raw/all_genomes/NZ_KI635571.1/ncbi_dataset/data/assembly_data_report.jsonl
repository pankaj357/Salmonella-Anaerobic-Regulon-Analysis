IA8590 was obtained from swine.\n\nThis project was designed as a Salmonella enterica comparative genomics study, with the goal of determining diagnostic polymorphisms, validating serotyping, making more precise taxonomic and phylogenetic classifications, evaluating recombination and clonality as well as determining evolutionary rates and modes of antibiotic resistance.\n\nCoding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer3 v3.02. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer3 were blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions generated based on protein alignments. tRNA genes were determined using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 and non-coding RNA genes by RNAmmer-1.2 and Rfam v8.1. The final gene set is processed through several programs such as Kegg (Release 56), psortB (Version 3.0.3) and Interproscan (Version 4.7) to determine possible function. Gene product names are determined by BER (Version 2.5). Gene names are generated at the contig level and may not necessarily reflect any known order or orientation between contigs.\n\nThe National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Comparative Genomics in the Enterobacteriacae - National Institutes of Health (NIH) is funding the sequence characterization of this genome.","assemblyStatus":"current","pairedAssembly":{"accession":"GCA_000504705.2","status":"current","annotationName":"Annotation submitted by The Genome Institute"},"bioprojectAccession":"PRJNA168677","assemblyMethod":"Velvet v. 1.1.04","releaseDate":"2013-12-09"},"assemblyStats":{"totalSequenceLength":"4918965","totalUngappedLength":"4918225","numberOfContigs":181,"contigN50":60807,"contigL50":27,"numberOfScaffolds":144,"scaffoldN50":72655,"scaffoldL50":23,"numberOfComponentSequences":181,"gcCount":"2568953","gcPercent":52,"genomeCoverage":"59","atgcCount":"4918225"},"annotationInfo":{"name":"GCF_000504705.2-RS_2025_01_11","provider":"NCBI RefSeq","releaseDate":"2025-01-11","stats":{"geneCounts":{"total":4821,"proteinCoding":4610,"nonCoding":55,"pseudogene":156}},"method":"Best-placed reference protein set; GeneMarkS-2+","pipeline":"NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP)","softwareVersion":"6.9"},"wgsInfo":{"wgsProjectAccession":"AZGR01","masterWgsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AZGR00000000.1","wgsContigsUrl":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/AZGR01"},"currentAccession":"GCF_000504705.2","checkmInfo":{"checkmMarkerSet":"Salmonella enterica","checkmMarkerSetRank":"species","checkmVersion":"v1.2.3","completeness":99.59,"contamination":0.92,"completenessPercentile":55.282,"checkmSpeciesTaxId":28901},"averageNucleotideIdentity":{"taxonomyCheckStatus":"OK","matchStatus":"derived_species_match","submittedOrganism":"Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Cubana str. 76814","submittedSpecies":"Salmonella enterica","category":"category_na","submittedAniMatch":{"assembly":"GCA_000006945.2","organismName":"Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str.
